WEBVTT

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:04.605
<i>Listen up, people!</i>

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.976
If fingers need to be pointed,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.013
we know where to point them.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:12.981
They use the recovering economy

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:18.452
and the rising stock market
as their bulletproof vest.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.122
But whose money is it?

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.024
- Is it mine?
- No!

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:24.059
- Is it yours?
- No!

00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:26.661
- I can't hear you.
- No!

00:01:26.694 --> 00:01:31.666
And despite all this wealth
they are hoarding,

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:34.702
they have the gall to accuse us

00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:38.673
of trying to destroy society
with our policies

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:41.676
that promote equal pay
for women.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.713
Racial equality for all people.

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:47.849
And health care for everyone.

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.220
- Well, what do we say?
- Game over!

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:54.689
- Say that again!
- Game over!

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:58.026
- Say like you mean it!
- Game over!

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.897
They label us
"domestic terrorists"

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.701
when they're the ones
stifling our First Amendment

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:11.073
with ruthless threats
and divisive political warfare.

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:20.082
Financial greed and unbridled
power is all they know.

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.618
Well, now, we have
something to say!

00:02:24.652 --> 00:02:27.923
- Say it! Say it!
- Say it!

00:02:27.956 --> 00:02:32.260
If the leaders of
the United States Government

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:35.030
won't respect its people...

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:40.135
its people
will not respect them!

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:44.538
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.013
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.748
Um, could you...

00:03:29.217 --> 00:03:30.919
Never mind.

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:40.594
Ma'am. Sorry about that.

00:03:41.463 --> 00:03:43.999
- Hope it won't hurt my rating.
- No...

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.041
Come on, you cowards!

00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:34.309
- Come on!
- Shut up!

00:05:34.342 --> 00:05:37.711
- Everybody, move back!
- Get on out of here!

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:39.780
We want that shitbird spy!

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.782
Sir, we can't do that.
Now, please, back up!

00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:44.785
Hand the hussy over!

00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:46.264
Or we'll feed her and y'all
to T and Rex

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:48.456
one piece at a time.

00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:15.150
- You Robinson's special guy?
- I am.

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:17.852
- Thank goodness you're here.
- You called the local sheriff?

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.487
Of course not.

00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:20.989
Someone must have called it in

00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:24.226
when I unloaded my revolver
at the crazies.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.961
I panicked.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.804
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:50.252
Based on the fact these crazies
are about to bury you

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:53.021
in a shallow grave,
something happened.

00:06:54.822 --> 00:06:56.992
I've been out here
almost two years

00:06:57.025 --> 00:06:59.861
playing the part
with these racist bastards,

00:06:59.894 --> 00:07:01.997
and it's getting inside my head.

00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:05.333
I got sloppy.

00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:06.868
They found a few bugs.

00:07:06.901 --> 00:07:08.903
Somehow traced it back to me.

00:07:08.937 --> 00:07:11.573
Stop it, Special Agent Davidson.

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:14.442
I need you to keep your
wits intact.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.211
I thought it was your job

00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:18.179
to get me out of
this kind of situation.

00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:21.549
That is correct.
And I'm about to.

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.552
Come on, bitch!
Come on out!

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:26.197
You ain't pretty enough
to be this stupid.

00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:28.223
You're about to eat
some buckshot.

00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:32.193
Back up before someone
gets hurt!

00:08:26.648 --> 00:08:28.950
Which one of you wants
an extra hole in your head?

00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:31.986
Hey, let's light 'em up,
like a firework!

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.380
- Bitch.
- Move!

00:08:58.413 --> 00:09:00.014
- Move!
- Let's go!

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.993
- Stay back!
- Grab the hoses!

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.002
Get in the car.

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:22.470
Stay low.

00:09:24.038 --> 00:09:26.040
Come on! Come on!

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:32.414
Subtle.

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:41.122
Listen, can we
just cut to it?

00:09:41.156 --> 00:09:44.492
Are you officially
asking for my help?

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:46.227
Because if you are,

00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:48.363
I think I have a few solutions.

00:09:50.532 --> 00:09:53.568
Alright then, I'll handle it.

00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:55.403
We'll talk soon.

00:09:57.439 --> 00:09:59.507
The President's Chief of Staff
isn't happy

00:09:59.541 --> 00:10:03.344
with how local PD are handling
the millennial soapbox crowd.

00:10:03.378 --> 00:10:05.980
Didn't realize
the FBI was charged

00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:08.283
with crowd control
at the White House.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:10.185
At least they know who to call

00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:12.520
when they want
something done right.

00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:16.024
You ask me, all these politicos
are chasing their own shadows.

00:10:16.057 --> 00:10:18.526
If they wanna last longer
than one term,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.562
they need to smarten up

00:10:20.595 --> 00:10:24.732
and understand what got them
elected in the first place.

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.401
Fear.

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:28.369
When the people are afraid
for their jobs

00:10:28.403 --> 00:10:30.338
or their wallets,
or their lives,

00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:33.107
they want Uncle Sam
to protect them.

00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:35.343
So if these
politically-correct puppets

00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:38.713
wanna straighten out
ornery protesters,

00:10:38.746 --> 00:10:40.248
give 'em fear.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:44.118
Good thing they have you, Gabe.

00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:49.090
If I've learned anything,
this job's all about

00:10:49.123 --> 00:10:52.126
finding creative ways
of keeping the peace.

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:55.630
So...

00:10:55.663 --> 00:10:57.232
Davidson.

00:10:57.265 --> 00:10:58.766
She's pretty shaken up.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.401
I dropped her off at a facility.

00:11:00.435 --> 00:11:02.770
She's... being cleaned up
and debriefed.

00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:06.107
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.109
These deep covers
are like the birds

00:11:08.142 --> 00:11:10.512
that keep flying
into these windows.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:12.547
They wiggle and flop around
a whole lot,

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.617
but eventually they come back
to their senses.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.619
Yeah, most of the time.

00:11:17.652 --> 00:11:19.387
What a waste.

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.223
Lucky we got her out at all.

00:11:22.257 --> 00:11:24.225
Oh, I wouldn't call it luck.

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:27.795
I would call it having an ace
in the hole. You.

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:29.230
As always...

00:11:29.264 --> 00:11:31.633
I appreciate you making it
happen, Travis.

00:12:45.573 --> 00:12:49.177
<i>♪ Hey hey hey
hey hey hey ♪</i>

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.213
- Hey, princess.
- Grandpa!

00:12:52.246 --> 00:12:54.716
- Where'd you go?
- I was checking the perimeter.

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:56.751
- All clear?
- All clear.

00:12:56.784 --> 00:12:58.486
Let's get some cake.

00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:03.725
<i>♪ Hey hey hey
hey hey hey ♪</i>

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.496
- Stay at your place?
- I'd like to try a normal life.

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:10.231
Be in town more.

00:13:10.264 --> 00:13:11.934
Be more involved in her world.

00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:14.202
Retire?

00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:16.537
Is Gabe on board with this plan?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.485
Yeah, you haven't even mustered
up the courage to tell him.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.646
It's not that simple.
I'm going to. Soon.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.547
Open it. Open it!

00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:29.250
- Is that a purse?
- Wow!

00:13:29.283 --> 00:13:32.253
Maybe one or two weekends
a month.

00:13:32.286 --> 00:13:34.923
The odd weekday,
if we can make that work.

00:13:34.957 --> 00:13:36.591
You're busy enough
at the hospital.

00:13:36.624 --> 00:13:39.260
This way, I could help
take a bit of the load off.

00:13:39.293 --> 00:13:40.662
And it would be good for her.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.765
- And you know this how?
- She suggested it.

00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:45.700
She likes me.

00:13:45.733 --> 00:13:47.502
And she wants a male figure
in her life

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.570
on a, you know,
consistent basis.

00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:52.640
Dad, is that a dig
at my love life?

00:13:52.674 --> 00:13:54.943
Not at all.

00:13:54.977 --> 00:13:57.445
Not your fault
that deadbeat ran off.

00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:02.383
Maybe she does,
but... I'm just not convinced

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:05.353
that she needs one who's
borderline certifiable.

00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:08.456
It's not that bad.

00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:11.459
- How many exits?
- Exits?

00:14:11.492 --> 00:14:13.361
In this building.
How many exits?

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:14.963
What is it? What is it?

00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:25.373
She makes rounds...
checking to see

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:26.885
that all the doors in the house
are locked.

00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:28.309
Good.

00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:30.712
Every hour, on the hour.

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:32.313
Could be hereditary.

00:14:32.346 --> 00:14:34.415
Maybe, or she could be
learning it from you.

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:35.918
You know, first it's the locks.

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:38.653
Next it will be the windows,
the gas stove, the electricity,

00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:40.698
and before you know it, she's
going to be asking for a Beretta

00:14:40.722 --> 00:14:42.323
for her tenth birthday.

00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:44.960
That's too young
by a couple of years.

00:14:44.993 --> 00:14:46.828
Look, I'm handling it.

00:14:46.862 --> 00:14:49.263
It's under control.

00:14:49.297 --> 00:14:51.799
And besides,
a little paranoia's healthy.

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.602
You never know
what nutcases are out there.

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:57.005
I'm just giving her the tools
to protect herself.

00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:58.706
That's where you're wrong.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.641
You think that it's all about
protecting her?

00:15:00.675 --> 00:15:02.376
In reality, you might be the one

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.378
who turns her
into a crazy person.

00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.249
Three. Or five.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.955
Front entrance.
Fire exit on the right.

00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:14.923
Loading dock in the back.

00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:18.326
Two more, if you count
the windows in the bathrooms.

00:15:20.394 --> 00:15:23.031
Look, I wasn't a
great husband or father

00:15:23.065 --> 00:15:25.299
and I can't unwind that.

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.768
But if you give me the chance,

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.403
I'd like to be the best
grandfather I can be.

00:15:30.571 --> 00:15:33.407
This for Natalie, or you?

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:40.015
Thank you, gramps. I love it!

00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:42.084
You're welcome, sweetie.

00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:45.887
Oh.

00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:56.664
Washington News Cycle.

00:16:12.747 --> 00:16:14.950
Pass.

00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:17.618
- Pass!
- Drew.

00:16:17.652 --> 00:16:20.989
Yeah, Sofia Flores' death
is a tragedy.

00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:22.623
No one's arguing that.

00:16:22.657 --> 00:16:24.692
But to call out Metro PD
as criminal

00:16:24.725 --> 00:16:26.962
for not naming a suspect
or divulging evidence,

00:16:26.995 --> 00:16:28.563
that's not news.

00:16:28.596 --> 00:16:30.132
That's them doing their job.

00:16:30.165 --> 00:16:31.843
I've been writing about her
for over a year

00:16:31.867 --> 00:16:33.701
because she was the voice
of her generation

00:16:33.734 --> 00:16:35.837
spearheading a movement
for real change,

00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.773
and in return, was mowed down
in a hit-and-run.

00:16:38.806 --> 00:16:41.143
There's no reason to believe
it was anything other than

00:16:41.176 --> 00:16:44.445
wrong time, wrong place,
bad luck.

00:16:44.478 --> 00:16:46.114
No. No, no, no, no, no!

00:16:46.148 --> 00:16:49.417
Oh! God.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.919
That's gonna cost me a few quid.

00:16:50.953 --> 00:16:52.453
The SUV had no plates.

00:16:52.486 --> 00:16:54.098
The rideshare driver
was using a fake name.

00:16:54.122 --> 00:16:55.891
That's sketchy.

00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:00.761
Okay, so the SUV
was probably new.

00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:02.597
And I don't know,
the rideshare guy

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.740
was an illegal immigrant
who couldn't use his real name.

00:17:03.764 --> 00:17:04.967
Who's to say?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.902
If we don't post something
and make it news,

00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:09.437
it'll be like it never happened.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.139
That may be true.

00:17:11.173 --> 00:17:12.875
What you wrote isn't.

00:17:13.942 --> 00:17:16.144
Look, I appreciate your
enthusiasm for the movement,

00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:17.612
I really do.

00:17:17.645 --> 00:17:20.148
But news stories
are based on facts.

00:17:20.182 --> 00:17:21.850
Find them first

00:17:21.884 --> 00:17:23.451
then write your story.

00:18:07.262 --> 00:18:09.998
Hey, buddy,
you can't park here.

00:18:10.032 --> 00:18:11.832
Okay.

00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:13.869
Yeah, yeah...

00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:15.736
I... I'll move it.

00:18:18.006 --> 00:18:19.942
Gun! Put your hands up!

00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:20.876
Look, I can explain.

00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:23.912
Show 'em!
Put your hands out the window!

00:18:23.946 --> 00:18:25.713
Step out of the vehicle.

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:29.617
Put your hands on your head.

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:33.855
Do not move.

00:19:07.122 --> 00:19:08.823
Freeze, asshole!

00:19:13.794 --> 00:19:15.763
You keep up
this routine,

00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:18.666
there's no way
you're walking out of here.

00:19:23.771 --> 00:19:26.174
I'm here to help,
but to do that properly,

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:29.144
I need more information.

00:19:29.177 --> 00:19:31.746
What were you planning on doing?

00:19:37.152 --> 00:19:40.621
The police found booze, pills
and a handgun in your vehicle.

00:19:41.756 --> 00:19:45.293
Were you thinking of putting
a round in your brainpan?

00:19:45.327 --> 00:19:46.328
No.

00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:47.896
Maybe you had a score to settle.

00:19:47.929 --> 00:19:49.231
Were you there to kill someone?

00:19:49.264 --> 00:19:50.966
- No.
- Rob a jewelry store?

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:52.642
Look, I wasn't gonna do anything
with the gun.

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:54.136
I was keeping it in the car.

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:55.303
On the passenger seat?

00:19:55.337 --> 00:19:57.239
I wasn't thinking straight,
okay?

00:19:57.272 --> 00:19:59.573
Are you now?

00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:07.548
Alright, Dusty. My time's up.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:12.854
You're welcome to stay, or we
can stroll out of here together.

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.757
But to do that,
you'll need to level with me.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.095
What were you doing?

00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:28.070
I was going to talk
to a reporter.

00:20:37.711 --> 00:20:39.081
Sign here for Dusty Crane.

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:43.118
Mike, uh, let's just say
this one was never here, yeah?

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.124
Thanks.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:57.832
- Where to, boss?
- A nice, quiet secure place.

00:20:57.866 --> 00:20:59.234
Where I get reprogrammed?

00:20:59.267 --> 00:21:03.138
Where you can screw your
priorities back on straight.

00:21:03.171 --> 00:21:05.806
And after that they'll assign me
to some small town field office

00:21:05.841 --> 00:21:06.984
where they can keep an eye on me

00:21:07.008 --> 00:21:08.742
while my soul slowly dies,
right?

00:21:08.776 --> 00:21:10.212
Or you work through this
speed bump

00:21:10.245 --> 00:21:14.149
in order to salvage what's left
of your promising career.

00:21:14.182 --> 00:21:15.783
I like you, Dusty.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.986
I like your passion. I like your
commitment to the job.

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:19.931
But you were on the verge of
making a bad choice.

00:21:19.955 --> 00:21:21.866
No, it wasn't a bad choice,
it was the right choice.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.791
Wrong. You took an oath.

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:25.726
You need to honor that.

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:26.895
Listen, work with me

00:21:26.928 --> 00:21:28.163
and I'll spin it with Robinson

00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:29.663
as best I can.

00:21:29.697 --> 00:21:30.866
Get you back on track.

00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:32.267
Oh, you don't get it, Block.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.002
It's gone too far.

00:21:34.035 --> 00:21:35.812
We're crossing lines that should
never be crossed.

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.838
Guys like you and me,
we don't decide

00:21:37.873 --> 00:21:39.307
where those lines are drawn.

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:42.210
The only thing you need to know
is whose orders you follow.

00:21:44.212 --> 00:21:46.882
Your loyalties lie
on the wrong side of the future.

00:21:46.915 --> 00:21:49.151
I don't expect everyone
to cope with the mind games

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:51.219
that come with
deep undercover work.

00:21:51.253 --> 00:21:53.155
Once you're in it,
it's hard to tell

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:56.224
which way is up, down,
right, wrong.

00:21:56.258 --> 00:21:57.859
But you're an intelligent guy

00:21:57.893 --> 00:21:59.995
and I do expect you
to cope with it.

00:22:01.963 --> 00:22:03.965
You do whatever you gotta do
to me.

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:06.301
I'm not playing
by the Bureau's rules anymore.

00:22:06.334 --> 00:22:08.036
We'll see about that.

00:22:11.473 --> 00:22:14.775
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

00:22:23.084 --> 00:22:25.220
This where my
re-education begins?

00:22:27.755 --> 00:22:29.057
Wrist.

00:22:38.766 --> 00:22:41.503
- Grandpa!
- Hey, sweetie.

00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:44.306
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:45.907
I needed that hug.

00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:48.809
It's okay.
I know you have to work.

00:22:48.843 --> 00:22:52.480
Yeah. Um, you here
all by yourself?

00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:54.482
Well, not anymore.

00:22:54.516 --> 00:22:56.084
Ready to go?
It's our night.

00:22:56.117 --> 00:22:58.819
But when you didn't
answer your phone,

00:22:58.853 --> 00:23:02.257
Miss Lewis called mommy
at the hospital.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.194
So now I'm supposed to sit tight
and wait for her.

00:23:06.228 --> 00:23:08.230
Oh, I see.

00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:11.933
But that doesn't mean
you can't stay here with me.

00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:17.138
Uh... it certainly doesn't.

00:23:23.144 --> 00:23:25.213
Hey, kid!

00:23:25.247 --> 00:23:26.881
Come here.

00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:29.251
You a criminal?

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:32.087
If it's... if it's a crime to
speak the truth, buddy,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.355
then, yes, I am.

00:23:35.223 --> 00:23:37.225
Uh, hey, no, I wouldn't do that.

00:23:40.362 --> 00:23:43.098
I like those buttons, though.
Can I see one of those?

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:45.799
Looks like a fun picnic.

00:23:45.833 --> 00:23:46.968
Who are these two?

00:23:47.002 --> 00:23:49.237
This is me, and that's mommy.

00:23:49.271 --> 00:23:52.107
Of course, which means
that must be me.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.977
No, you silly bean.
That's a stranger.

00:24:00.515 --> 00:24:02.884
What, what's a stranger doing?

00:24:02.917 --> 00:24:04.519
Watching us.

00:24:04.552 --> 00:24:06.121
Watching you? Why?

00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:07.422
Has someone been watching you?

00:24:07.455 --> 00:24:08.857
I don't know.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.892
I need you to know.

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:17.132
I'm sorry, Natalie. It's okay.

00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:19.434
It's just very important for you
always to be aware,

00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:20.902
like I've taught you.

00:24:20.935 --> 00:24:22.304
But I am.

00:24:22.337 --> 00:24:24.172
And tell me if anyone

00:24:24.205 --> 00:24:26.608
strange comes up to you,
approaches you.

00:24:26.641 --> 00:24:28.443
Okay, I will.

00:24:28.476 --> 00:24:29.978
Good girl. Thank you.

00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:32.247
Are bad guys gonna hurt you?

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.982
Hurt me? Nah.

00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:35.283
Why would you think that?

00:24:35.317 --> 00:24:38.153
Because mommy says
your job is dangerous.

00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:41.389
Don't worry.
She exaggerates.

00:24:41.423 --> 00:24:43.124
It's not that dangerous.

00:24:43.158 --> 00:24:47.062
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
or you.

00:24:47.095 --> 00:24:49.164
- Or mommy?
- Or mommy.

00:24:50.999 --> 00:24:53.335
Mommy!

00:24:53.368 --> 00:24:55.970
Hi, sweetie. Grandpa.

00:25:09.117 --> 00:25:11.486
Dusty! Don't do this!

00:25:17.025 --> 00:25:18.360
I think you have an admirer.

00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:20.462
Does he live in a castle
and have a heart of gold?

00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:21.930
He's on line three.

00:25:21.963 --> 00:25:23.574
Says your last few articles
on Sofia Flores

00:25:23.598 --> 00:25:25.033
were inspirational.

00:25:25.066 --> 00:25:26.277
Was Prince Charming
slurring his words?

00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:27.902
Claims he can guarantee you
a story

00:25:27.936 --> 00:25:31.106
worthy of a dozen
clickbait headlines.

00:25:31.139 --> 00:25:33.241
- Just tell me what it is.
- No.

00:25:33.274 --> 00:25:35.243
No, it's too dangerous
to do over the phone.

00:25:35.276 --> 00:25:37.145
They're listening.
They're always listening.

00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:41.492
I'm gonna come to you,
we'll find some place quiet

00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:43.218
to talk about it.

00:25:47.422 --> 00:25:49.624
- When?
- How about five minutes?

00:26:14.716 --> 00:26:16.551
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

00:26:16.584 --> 00:26:17.919
No!

00:26:21.222 --> 00:26:23.224
- Look out!
- Move!

00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:39.140
What the hell are you doing?

00:26:39.174 --> 00:26:41.042
I'm going to free my conscience!

00:26:41.075 --> 00:26:43.144
Watch out!

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.295
- Get out of the way! Move!
- Hey!

00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:35.530
Stop!

00:28:00.488 --> 00:28:02.423
No, no, no, no, no!

00:28:55.209 --> 00:28:56.578
- Are you Mira?
- Yeah, you are?

00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:58.580
Being followed.
Let's go somewhere private.

00:28:58.613 --> 00:29:01.149
Wait! What exactly is this
all about?

00:29:01.182 --> 00:29:02.550
Look, this is really important.

00:29:02.584 --> 00:29:04.395
We're gonna have to do this
another time, okay?

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:05.787
No, wait!

00:29:39.354 --> 00:29:40.531
The last person
on the planet

00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:43.658
I need talking to the
press is Crane.

00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:46.427
He should be
in a secure mental facility.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.765
Natalie's school?

00:29:50.798 --> 00:29:53.234
What the hell were you thinking?

00:29:53.267 --> 00:29:55.370
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

00:29:55.403 --> 00:29:57.805
Bad timing. Poor judgement.

00:29:57.839 --> 00:29:59.507
He say anything to you?

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.744
He was having a moral code
moment.

00:30:02.777 --> 00:30:04.479
Said we were crossing the line.

00:30:04.512 --> 00:30:07.916
Must feel nice to be that naive.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.250
Is that all?

00:30:09.283 --> 00:30:10.685
Just that he's done following

00:30:10.718 --> 00:30:11.920
the Bureau's rules,

00:30:11.954 --> 00:30:15.924
and based on his little
truck stunt...

00:30:15.958 --> 00:30:17.392
I tend to believe him.

00:30:17.425 --> 00:30:19.527
He's a live grenade.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.262
This one makes it
to the front page,

00:30:21.295 --> 00:30:22.965
I'm gonna catch heat
from every direction.

00:30:22.998 --> 00:30:25.700
Stupid thing!

00:30:25.733 --> 00:30:29.537
I haven't properly worn one of
these since Margaret passed.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.941
- Yeah, she had a gift.
- That she did.

00:30:32.975 --> 00:30:35.376
Bless her soul.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.514
Letting Crane slip through your
fingers, not like you.

00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:43.351
Are you alright?

00:30:43.384 --> 00:30:45.888
Yeah, I've just been feeling
a bit distracted.

00:30:45.921 --> 00:30:48.891
Well, no need to
hold it in with me, buddy.

00:30:48.924 --> 00:30:50.658
What's the trouble?

00:30:50.692 --> 00:30:53.828
I'm trying to spend more time
with Natalie.

00:30:53.862 --> 00:30:55.864
And?

00:30:55.898 --> 00:30:59.400
At this point, Amanda doesn't
trust me, for good reason.

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:00.969
I need to change that.

00:31:01.003 --> 00:31:03.204
Anything I can do to help?

00:31:04.873 --> 00:31:07.009
Actually, Gabe...

00:31:07.042 --> 00:31:08.977
I've been thinking.

00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:11.279
Maybe it's time I hang it up.

00:31:11.312 --> 00:31:14.582
No. No, no, no.

00:31:14.615 --> 00:31:15.984
Not an option.

00:31:16.018 --> 00:31:18.386
The thing is,
it's been over 20 years

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:19.988
of the unpredictable.

00:31:20.022 --> 00:31:21.622
Never knowing
when you're gonna call

00:31:21.656 --> 00:31:24.026
where you're gonna send me
and for how long.

00:31:24.059 --> 00:31:26.394
Which has made relationships
difficult.

00:31:26.427 --> 00:31:29.597
And now... Natalie needs
stability in her life,

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.365
and I want to be that for her.

00:31:31.399 --> 00:31:34.036
I appreciate the importance
of family, God knows.

00:31:34.069 --> 00:31:35.603
Look at me.

00:31:35.636 --> 00:31:40.508
But what you do is crucial,
important work.

00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:42.777
Our people
go to dangerous places,

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.746
physically and mentally.

00:31:44.779 --> 00:31:46.481
And when they go astray,

00:31:46.514 --> 00:31:49.885
I need you to bring them back

00:31:49.918 --> 00:31:52.253
before they grow horns.

00:31:53.588 --> 00:31:56.357
Saving good agents' souls.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.493
Whatever it takes.

00:32:00.963 --> 00:32:02.630
I'll tell you what.

00:32:02.663 --> 00:32:05.833
Once Dusty's in a cell
and I have the key,

00:32:05.868 --> 00:32:08.503
we'll work out a way
for you to spend more time

00:32:08.536 --> 00:32:11.006
with your granddaughter.

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:12.473
Deal?

00:32:15.576 --> 00:32:17.980
Out of curiosity,
I pulled our security footage

00:32:18.013 --> 00:32:19.747
from when I met this guy.

00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:21.315
Uh, do you have a name?

00:32:21.349 --> 00:32:22.693
No, but our security guards
recognized him.

00:32:22.717 --> 00:32:24.385
It's the same guy
who was arrested

00:32:24.418 --> 00:32:26.554
for fighting the cops
across the street.

00:32:26.587 --> 00:32:28.924
Your fighter's your runner?

00:32:28.957 --> 00:32:31.459
You've looked better.
Did you sleep at all last night?

00:32:31.492 --> 00:32:33.461
Define sleep.

00:32:33.494 --> 00:32:35.864
You know you can just
record your stupid games

00:32:35.898 --> 00:32:37.765
and watch them later.

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:39.634
That's rather like
jumping to the belly ache

00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:41.079
after you've overeaten
without actually

00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:43.805
enjoying the cake first.

00:32:43.838 --> 00:32:47.375
I checked every police station
within 50 miles of here.

00:32:47.408 --> 00:32:50.645
No record of his arrest.

00:32:50.678 --> 00:32:52.613
This feels like another
Mira special.

00:32:52.647 --> 00:32:54.415
You don't find that strange?

00:32:54.448 --> 00:32:55.817
Maybe they just let him go

00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:57.685
to avoid another police
brutality charge.

00:32:57.718 --> 00:33:00.354
He beat the crap
out of four cops.

00:33:03.724 --> 00:33:05.760
Okay. Maybe you're right.

00:33:07.963 --> 00:33:09.898
So, what's the headline?

00:33:09.932 --> 00:33:13.936
I didn't say I have a draft,
or even an angle. I just...

00:33:13.969 --> 00:33:17.705
He contacted me.
He could be a legitimate source.

00:33:17.738 --> 00:33:19.740
Or a nutcase
wanting to go viral.

00:33:55.143 --> 00:33:59.580
So... no bank
or credit card activity?

00:34:01.116 --> 00:34:03.451
Okay, what about
under Dusty's alias?

00:34:03.484 --> 00:34:06.054
His last known cover was...

00:34:06.088 --> 00:34:08.723
Uh-huh. I see.

00:34:08.756 --> 00:34:11.626
Well, keep an eye on it,
will ya?

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:12.793
Thanks.

00:34:29.144 --> 00:34:33.015
<i>No, you silly bean,
that's a stranger...</i>

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.554
<i>Watching us...</i>

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.863
- Got him?
- Oh, yeah.

00:34:47.896 --> 00:34:48.931
Grandpa!

00:34:48.964 --> 00:34:51.732
Hey, pumpkin.
Where have you been?

00:34:51.766 --> 00:34:53.668
At the park,
flying my kite.

00:34:53.701 --> 00:34:56.504
Oh, that sounds fun.
You get it high up in the air?

00:34:56.537 --> 00:34:59.774
Not really.
I couldn't run fast enough.

00:34:59.807 --> 00:35:03.544
- But mommy did.
- Oh, good job, mommy.

00:35:03.577 --> 00:35:05.546
Go inside and wash up
for dinner, please.

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:07.648
Can you stay and eat with us?

00:35:07.682 --> 00:35:10.052
We're having homemade pizza.

00:35:10.085 --> 00:35:11.987
Oh, I love pizza.

00:35:14.022 --> 00:35:15.723
Pizza it is.

00:35:17.259 --> 00:35:19.895
That was four times.

00:35:19.928 --> 00:35:21.897
Four? Are you sure?

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.533
Oh, go again.
One, two, three.

00:35:28.803 --> 00:35:30.838
What are you doing?

00:35:30.872 --> 00:35:33.241
Ah, installing security cameras.

00:35:33.275 --> 00:35:34.843
On my house?

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:36.912
For Natalie's safety.
And yours.

00:35:36.945 --> 00:35:38.713
I know that I should just say
thank you,

00:35:38.746 --> 00:35:41.682
and... some might consider that
very sweet of you,

00:35:41.716 --> 00:35:43.251
but you can't do
things like this

00:35:43.285 --> 00:35:44.853
without asking my permission.

00:35:44.886 --> 00:35:46.520
I was concerned
you would say no.

00:35:46.554 --> 00:35:47.923
And you'd probably be right.

00:35:47.956 --> 00:35:50.058
She's drawing pictures
of strangers, watching her.

00:35:50.092 --> 00:35:53.627
And what do you think is
feeding her growing paranoia?

00:35:53.661 --> 00:35:56.999
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

00:35:57.032 --> 00:36:01.003
And I admit it. I screwed up
on multiple occasions.

00:36:01.036 --> 00:36:03.005
But you've got to know,
I'm trying to fix things.

00:36:03.038 --> 00:36:05.941
Natalie doesn't need a fixer
like you.

00:36:08.343 --> 00:36:10.178
You sound just like your mother.

00:36:10.212 --> 00:36:12.613
Before or after she left us?

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.653
I'm worried about you, dad.

00:36:19.687 --> 00:36:21.189
There's nothing to worry about.

00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:22.690
That's why I'm worried.

00:36:22.723 --> 00:36:23.992
Because maybe you can't see it,

00:36:24.026 --> 00:36:27.295
but you're not the same dad
that I remember.

00:36:27.329 --> 00:36:28.605
You know,
when I was Natalie's age,

00:36:28.629 --> 00:36:29.931
your quirks were cute.

00:36:29.965 --> 00:36:32.167
Getting my bicycle serviced
every few months.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.769
Waking up at 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
to make sure all the doors

00:36:34.802 --> 00:36:36.171
and windows were still locked,

00:36:36.204 --> 00:36:39.307
and getting background checks
on my friends' parents.

00:36:39.341 --> 00:36:41.776
Your quirks
aren't quirks anymore.

00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:45.981
You need to accept that
and you need to deal with it.

00:36:46.014 --> 00:36:47.648
I sometimes wonder

00:36:47.681 --> 00:36:49.750
did the disorder change you

00:36:49.784 --> 00:36:51.987
or was it your dirty job?

00:36:55.689 --> 00:36:58.026
Finish with the cameras.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.929
So please don't do anything else
without asking first.

00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:16.644
Can I get
either of you gentlemen

00:37:16.677 --> 00:37:18.113
something to drink?

00:37:19.647 --> 00:37:21.749
No thank you, ma'am.

00:37:27.189 --> 00:37:29.191
Special Agent Lockhart.

00:37:29.224 --> 00:37:30.859
Special Agent Wallace.

00:37:30.892 --> 00:37:32.360
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

00:37:32.394 --> 00:37:34.129
Come in.

00:37:59.753 --> 00:38:01.223
Don't let baggy pants
get to you.

00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:04.658
I just can't believe Sarah falls
for his blatant ass-kissing.

00:38:04.692 --> 00:38:06.294
She's too smart for that.

00:38:06.328 --> 00:38:08.930
My take is, she enjoys it.

00:38:08.964 --> 00:38:11.032
Found this on the police wire.

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:14.002
- Is that your guy?
- I think it is.

00:38:17.838 --> 00:38:21.409
Not exactly a dream date.
But he is kinda hot.

00:38:21.443 --> 00:38:23.145
Wanted by
the DC Police Department.

00:38:23.178 --> 00:38:26.047
Considered armed
and mentally unstable.

00:38:26.081 --> 00:38:28.850
Hm, I wonder if I should be
curious or scared

00:38:28.884 --> 00:38:30.185
about what he wanted to tell me.

00:38:30.218 --> 00:38:32.187
Probably both.

00:38:34.788 --> 00:38:36.657
"Possession."

00:38:38.426 --> 00:38:41.263
"Disturbing the peace.

00:38:41.296 --> 00:38:43.231
Assault with a deadly weapon."

00:38:49.803 --> 00:38:51.805
Shh! Shh! Shh!

00:38:57.913 --> 00:38:59.747
Mira Jones?

00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:01.983
Maybe.

00:39:02.017 --> 00:39:04.953
I have information
about your story.

00:39:04.986 --> 00:39:07.088
The one that ran away.

00:39:12.961 --> 00:39:15.763
- You have a name, Agent?
- I'm not an agent.

00:39:15.796 --> 00:39:18.300
This isn't an interview.
Please, turn it off.

00:39:20.001 --> 00:39:22.770
- Who is he?
- You tell me.

00:39:22.803 --> 00:39:26.341
- Why were you meeting him?
- Why did you chase him away?

00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:28.709
Has he contacted you again?

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:32.380
Listen.

00:39:32.414 --> 00:39:34.516
He's wanted on multiple counts.

00:39:34.549 --> 00:39:36.151
If you know where he is,

00:39:36.184 --> 00:39:38.086
you're an accessory
after the fact.

00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:41.089
Oh, well, thank you for
stopping by and informing me.

00:39:41.122 --> 00:39:45.093
I think Little Man's finished,
Mr. Not-An-Agent.

00:39:45.126 --> 00:39:48.230
The man needs professional help.
He's unbalanced.

00:39:48.263 --> 00:39:52.000
Yeah, I read all about
our friend Dusty's problems.

00:39:53.134 --> 00:39:54.502
Guess you don't
have a subscription

00:39:54.536 --> 00:39:56.171
to the police wire.

00:39:56.204 --> 00:39:57.838
He's on the police wire?

00:39:57.872 --> 00:39:59.474
Are we done?

00:39:59.507 --> 00:40:01.843
I think we're done.

00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:03.979
I don't know
what his intentions were

00:40:04.012 --> 00:40:06.248
or why he made contact with you.

00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:08.116
But let me be clear.

00:40:08.149 --> 00:40:11.152
He's not a source for you to
make your fledgling career on.

00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:14.022
- Let it go.
- Okay, this is intimidation.

00:40:14.055 --> 00:40:17.259
And you know nothing about me
or my fledgling career.

00:40:17.292 --> 00:40:20.295
Name "James Van Dorn"
mean anything to you?

00:40:22.297 --> 00:40:24.532
No.

00:40:24.566 --> 00:40:28.136
Mr. Van Dorn and his wife lived
in a comfortable six-bedroom

00:40:28.169 --> 00:40:31.239
brownstone across
from Montrose Park.

00:40:31.273 --> 00:40:33.541
Plenty of room for them
and their three kids.

00:40:33.575 --> 00:40:35.277
But that wasn't enough for him.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.479
He also had a thing
for his secretary.

00:40:37.512 --> 00:40:41.383
He made a mistake, had a
daughter, whom he disowned.

00:40:41.416 --> 00:40:45.453
She's... probably about 30 now.

00:40:45.487 --> 00:40:46.855
A struggling journalist

00:40:46.888 --> 00:40:49.157
who lives in a
shoebox-sized apartment

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.026
and writes under a pseudonym

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:54.929
because her father demanded
she spare him the embarrassment.

00:40:54.963 --> 00:40:56.164
Get out of my way.

00:40:56.197 --> 00:40:59.067
Quoting a source who isn't sane

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.004
could get you sued
for libel or fired.

00:41:03.038 --> 00:41:06.408
Although, in this case,
I'd say both are probable.

00:41:06.441 --> 00:41:07.609
There's no story here.

00:41:07.642 --> 00:41:09.344
- Says who?
- Says me.

00:41:10.912 --> 00:41:13.048
Okay.

00:41:13.081 --> 00:41:14.215
Thanks.

00:41:15.583 --> 00:41:18.286
For confirming that
there is a story. Goodnight.

00:41:20.055 --> 00:41:24.259
He contacts you, you contact me.
Got it?

00:41:24.292 --> 00:41:28.630
Take my word for it.
Don't play news hero.

00:41:28.663 --> 00:41:30.231
Don't.

00:41:57.625 --> 00:42:00.228
Dusty, we don't want trouble.

00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:01.129
Too late.

00:42:01.162 --> 00:42:02.630
Robinson just wants to talk.

00:42:02.664 --> 00:42:06.534
Let us take you to him. You two
can work out your differences.

00:42:06.568 --> 00:42:07.602
Good plan.

00:43:07.996 --> 00:43:11.132
The FBI shows up at my
door and tries to intimidate me

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:15.170
because this mentally unstable
guy contacted me?

00:43:15.203 --> 00:43:17.005
Maybe he's not
so crazy after all.

00:43:17.038 --> 00:43:18.339
You sure he's a Fed?

00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:22.277
The whole thing smells
a tad unusual.

00:43:23.144 --> 00:43:25.447
Do you... do you want me
to check it out?

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.582
No, I got it.

00:43:27.615 --> 00:43:29.417
Okay.

00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:31.753
But you might want to start
adding some actual detail

00:43:31.786 --> 00:43:33.188
because right now,
the only story

00:43:33.221 --> 00:43:35.523
you're writing is in your head.

00:43:35.557 --> 00:43:38.293
Are you implying that
I'm the crazy one?

00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:43.198
No. You're the eager one.

00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:46.067
Listen, if there is a story
to be found here,

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.478
you'll need to take note
of the obvious

00:43:47.502 --> 00:43:50.572
and then scrutinize what the
obvious obscures

00:43:50.605 --> 00:43:52.173
like an ultra-violet light

00:43:52.207 --> 00:43:55.210
illuminating what the
naked eye can't see.

00:43:55.243 --> 00:44:00.248
But if you do find something,
tread lightly.

00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:01.516
You've got a call.

00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:03.218
Just a minute.

00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:04.752
It's your secret admirer.

00:44:07.655 --> 00:44:08.990
This is Mira.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.183
Government,
even in its best state,

00:45:09.217 --> 00:45:12.687
is but a necessary evil.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.258
In its worst state,
it's an intolerable evil.

00:45:17.292 --> 00:45:19.327
Now you might think
these words were said

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.530
last night on a podcast
or a news program

00:45:22.564 --> 00:45:26.501
about today's state of
the world, but you'd be wrong.

00:45:26.534 --> 00:45:31.606
Those words were written by
Thomas Paine in 1776.

00:45:53.628 --> 00:45:55.830
Move! Go, go, go!

00:45:55.864 --> 00:45:57.565
Hey!

00:46:12.915 --> 00:46:14.315
We got him.

00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:16.217
Sir, you need to slow down.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.619
I promise you,
this is a bad idea.

00:46:54.455 --> 00:46:55.657
Enough, Dusty!

00:47:06.434 --> 00:47:09.203
- Time to come in.
- Just like that?

00:47:09.237 --> 00:47:10.648
After you sent those two
shitheads to kill me?

00:47:10.672 --> 00:47:13.608
What? I didn't send anyone
to do anything to you.

00:47:18.312 --> 00:47:19.647
What shitheads?

00:47:20.815 --> 00:47:22.684
You can't bullshit me!

00:47:44.305 --> 00:47:45.974
You're slipping.

00:47:46.008 --> 00:47:47.976
You're losing your edge.

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.244
It's not too late.

00:47:50.278 --> 00:47:52.747
I can help you come back with
dignity. Get your life back.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.549
I'm done with that life.

00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.317
You can't run far enough.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:59.454
They'll find you,
cut you off at the knees.

00:47:59.487 --> 00:48:00.932
Whatever you're
telling this journalist,

00:48:00.956 --> 00:48:02.390
they'll call it treason.

00:48:02.423 --> 00:48:04.459
- That's 30 to life.
- I can live with that.

00:48:04.492 --> 00:48:07.562
No. You're not
thinking straight.

00:48:07.595 --> 00:48:10.465
It was all part of the job.
You just got in too deep.

00:48:10.498 --> 00:48:11.775
Well, deep enough
to see the truth.

00:48:11.799 --> 00:48:13.434
We're killing
innocent civilians.

00:48:13.468 --> 00:48:15.603
People that are
trying to make a difference!

00:48:15.636 --> 00:48:17.839
- Who's we?
- The Bureau.

00:48:17.873 --> 00:48:19.908
And you know this how?

00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:25.446
Because I was one of the agents
ordered to do the killing.

00:48:26.882 --> 00:48:30.251
Innocent civilians?
Under whose orders?

00:48:31.786 --> 00:48:33.488
Robinson's.

00:48:33.521 --> 00:48:35.623
That's a serious accusation.

00:48:38.326 --> 00:48:39.494
I'm going to prove it.

00:48:39.527 --> 00:48:41.629
Listen, I wanna hear
all about it.

00:48:41.662 --> 00:48:43.331
Dusty. Dusty!

00:48:47.668 --> 00:48:48.669
Ah!

00:49:25.908 --> 00:49:27.809
What just happened?

00:49:30.711 --> 00:49:31.951
Do you know who those men were?

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.949
No, do... do you?

00:49:33.982 --> 00:49:35.083
What did Dusty say to you?

00:49:35.117 --> 00:49:37.853
Uh, he... he was bringing...

00:49:37.886 --> 00:49:40.588
Bringing you what?
What was he bringing you?

00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:43.691
This is all my fault.

00:49:43.724 --> 00:49:46.895
Mira, look at me.
Tell me what it was.

00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:49.932
Documents.

00:49:49.965 --> 00:49:51.066
What kind of documents?

00:49:51.099 --> 00:49:52.600
His orders.

00:49:54.136 --> 00:49:55.603
Proof.

00:50:38.679 --> 00:50:40.514
Something on your mind?

00:50:42.184 --> 00:50:45.586
It's a sad day, no doubt.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.189
Well, let's be honest.

00:50:47.222 --> 00:50:49.624
The kid had a few
too many loose screws.

00:50:49.657 --> 00:50:52.493
Or he had a bright future,
until something...

00:50:54.196 --> 00:50:57.498
or someone pushed him too far.

00:50:59.834 --> 00:51:01.870
Still don't know
who those two men were?

00:51:01.904 --> 00:51:05.473
No. At this point,
we still don't know.

00:51:06.774 --> 00:51:09.211
He was one of the good guys.

00:51:09.244 --> 00:51:11.046
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

00:51:11.079 --> 00:51:15.217
Well, unfortunately for him,
you got distracted.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.219
If you'd done your job,

00:51:17.252 --> 00:51:19.420
we wouldn't be wearing
these suits today.

00:51:20.588 --> 00:51:22.891
It's tragic,
but now it's finished.

00:51:22.925 --> 00:51:25.660
Let's point our focus back
where it needs to be.

00:51:26.962 --> 00:51:28.964
Plenty more souls to save.

00:51:30.899 --> 00:51:32.466
Yeah.

00:51:47.849 --> 00:51:50.085
What are you watching, grandpa?

00:51:50.118 --> 00:51:52.653
Oh, nothing, sweetie.

00:51:52.687 --> 00:51:55.823
Hey, you and Lambie
should be in bed.

00:51:55.857 --> 00:51:58.060
I can't sleep.

00:51:58.093 --> 00:52:00.461
Uh-huh? Come here.

00:52:02.097 --> 00:52:03.265
Attagirl.

00:52:03.298 --> 00:52:05.566
Thinking about your big play?

00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:06.834
Everything okay?

00:52:06.868 --> 00:52:09.737
I think I'm worried about you.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.807
Me? You sound like your mother.

00:52:12.841 --> 00:52:14.542
There's nothing to worry about.

00:52:18.046 --> 00:52:20.248
Well...

00:52:20.282 --> 00:52:23.751
You know...
some people live

00:52:23.784 --> 00:52:26.855
their entire lives thinking
they're doing the right thing...

00:52:28.156 --> 00:52:33.095
even if it means doing
whatever is proper...

00:52:34.595 --> 00:52:36.965
to make sure the good guys
always win.

00:52:36.999 --> 00:52:42.871
But then, one day
you wake up and realize...

00:52:42.904 --> 00:52:45.874
you're not sure who the
good guys are anymore.

00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:48.844
Which makes you wonder...

00:52:50.778 --> 00:52:52.848
have I been doing
the right thing?

00:52:53.915 --> 00:52:55.017
Am I a good guy?

00:52:56.118 --> 00:52:57.585
Grandpa?

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.588
Are you a good guy?

00:53:04.993 --> 00:53:06.727
I wanna be.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.684
You're not doing anywhere
worthwhile here.

00:53:31.887 --> 00:53:33.321
Go home.

00:53:33.355 --> 00:53:35.090
Take a couple of days.

00:53:36.224 --> 00:53:37.658
Mira.

00:53:39.995 --> 00:53:41.796
Home. Go.

00:53:47.802 --> 00:53:49.938
- Mira.
- Oh, hey.

00:53:51.406 --> 00:53:53.075
Are... are you following me?

00:53:53.108 --> 00:53:54.209
No.

00:53:54.242 --> 00:53:56.677
But I did wanna come see you.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.579
How're you holding up?

00:53:59.814 --> 00:54:01.917
- Not so good.
- Yeah.

00:54:03.684 --> 00:54:05.987
You, uh, you like whiskey?

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.691
This everything Dusty told you?

00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:11.993
That's it.

00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:15.830
What's this "Operation U?"

00:54:15.864 --> 00:54:17.698
Unity. Operation Unity.

00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:20.068
Did he say what its mission is?

00:54:28.243 --> 00:54:29.978
These are picked up.

00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:34.249
Are you being followed?

00:54:34.282 --> 00:54:35.816
Maybe.

00:54:38.887 --> 00:54:42.723
Long story short, he was a
deep cover agent in Miami.

00:54:42.756 --> 00:54:45.961
Got sniffy with the cocaine
he was tracking.

00:54:45.994 --> 00:54:48.363
When I found him, he was
in the Everglades,

00:54:48.396 --> 00:54:51.032
wrestling an alligator
for sport.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.734
Interesting friend.

00:54:53.767 --> 00:54:55.736
Not a friend. Debtor.

00:54:55.769 --> 00:54:58.006
- For?
- Saving his life.

00:54:59.773 --> 00:55:01.775
How long you been doing that?

00:55:02.944 --> 00:55:05.679
Oh, probably too long.

00:55:15.957 --> 00:55:17.691
What's with the three thing?

00:55:17.725 --> 00:55:22.898
I have thoughts looping inside
my head, repeating themselves.

00:55:22.931 --> 00:55:24.866
If I do something three times,

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:27.269
I can usually
suppress the thought.

00:55:27.302 --> 00:55:28.836
Obsessive compulsive.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:33.741
Sometimes the obsessing makes me
better at what I do.

00:55:33.774 --> 00:55:36.178
Other times...

00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:39.214
Other times, I feel like I
should be locked away.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:43.952
What happened to you?

00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:50.791
I... screwed up.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:55.696
I served one tour in Vietnam.
I wasn't even 20.

00:55:56.364 --> 00:55:59.767
April 1975.

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.978
It was the night before
we pulled out

00:56:01.002 --> 00:56:02.836
all our troops and went home.

00:56:04.439 --> 00:56:06.740
I was on patrol duty
with Robinson...

00:56:06.774 --> 00:56:08.043
Director of the FBI?

00:56:08.076 --> 00:56:11.079
The younger version, yes.

00:56:11.112 --> 00:56:14.815
We were talking about everything
we would do when we got home.

00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:16.817
Then we turned a corner
into a dark alley,

00:56:16.851 --> 00:56:20.488
and there was this man
about to...

00:56:20.522 --> 00:56:23.058
rape a local woman.

00:56:23.091 --> 00:56:25.060
It was hard to see,
but it was obvious

00:56:25.093 --> 00:56:27.229
he was roughing her up
pretty bad.

00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:30.966
I called out,
and he turned towards us

00:56:30.999 --> 00:56:33.001
with what I thought was a gun.

00:56:33.969 --> 00:56:37.005
So... I shot him.

00:56:38.139 --> 00:56:39.274
Kill him?

00:56:40.408 --> 00:56:41.977
Yeah.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.945
Then what happened?

00:56:43.979 --> 00:56:45.480
The woman ran off.

00:56:45.513 --> 00:56:47.182
Robinson and I
went up to the guy.

00:56:47.215 --> 00:56:50.285
He was face down in a
puddle of his own blood.

00:56:51.553 --> 00:56:54.289
The gun was a bottle of whiskey.

00:56:54.322 --> 00:56:56.291
Robinson flipped him over.

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:02.030
He was our Commanding Officer.

00:57:02.063 --> 00:57:04.366
I panicked.
Robinson didn't.

00:57:04.399 --> 00:57:06.834
I can still hear his voice
like it was that night.

00:57:06.868 --> 00:57:08.769
"Walk away. Walk away."

00:57:10.171 --> 00:57:11.839
So I did.

00:57:11.873 --> 00:57:14.976
Robinson joined the FBI,
we lost touch.

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:18.913
Then about 15 years went by,
and the phone rang.

00:57:18.947 --> 00:57:20.482
He'd just been promoted.

00:57:20.515 --> 00:57:25.287
Asked if I would work directly
for him, off the books.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.023
Said it was his job
to protect the Bureau

00:57:28.056 --> 00:57:30.025
and mine to protect its agents.

00:57:30.058 --> 00:57:31.393
Off the books, that gives him

00:57:31.426 --> 00:57:33.428
plausible deniability for
anything you did.

00:57:33.461 --> 00:57:39.134
In hindsight, I suspect
I made a poor career choice.

00:57:39.167 --> 00:57:41.369
When you take orders for a
living, trying to support

00:57:41.403 --> 00:57:46.007
a family, you learn not to
question those orders...

00:57:46.041 --> 00:57:48.009
regardless of the
moral implications

00:57:48.043 --> 00:57:51.946
or how they may affect
other people's lives.

00:57:54.215 --> 00:57:56.418
So, other than
intimidating journalists,

00:57:56.451 --> 00:57:58.320
what other kind of
bad stuff do you do?

00:57:58.353 --> 00:58:01.323
You name it,
I've probably done it.

00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:03.091
Like?

00:58:03.124 --> 00:58:05.160
Breaking and entering,
extortion.

00:58:05.193 --> 00:58:08.063
Occasional physical coercion.

00:58:08.096 --> 00:58:09.931
Murder?

00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:13.201
That's not on my menu.

00:58:16.504 --> 00:58:20.475
And for the record, I changed
my name not for my father

00:58:20.508 --> 00:58:23.912
and his family, but out
of respect for my mother.

00:58:23.945 --> 00:58:25.647
He fired her three months
after I was born.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.182
She raised me all on her own

00:58:27.215 --> 00:58:30.352
and never once asked him
for anything.

00:58:30.385 --> 00:58:33.288
When I was old enough,
I changed my name to hers.

00:58:33.321 --> 00:58:35.357
I stand corrected.

00:58:36.991 --> 00:58:40.628
So, Mr. Block... what now?

00:58:53.341 --> 00:58:54.442
Where did you come from?

00:58:54.476 --> 00:58:56.511
What's Operation Unity?

00:58:56.544 --> 00:58:59.247
It's nothing that concerns you.

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.950
You know, I've always
respected my position

00:59:01.983 --> 00:59:06.221
in our arrangement...
but in this case,

00:59:06.254 --> 00:59:09.224
I prefer to be the one
who decides what concerns me.

00:59:10.425 --> 00:59:12.961
Unity. The truth, Gabe.

00:59:12.994 --> 00:59:15.096
It's not your place to know.

00:59:15.997 --> 00:59:18.266
Or even ask.

00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:21.369
So Dusty was right. You are
killing innocent people.

00:59:21.403 --> 00:59:25.006
You're running your own
secret program, Operation Unity.

00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:27.909
And when Dusty tried to go
public with it...

00:59:29.377 --> 00:59:30.912
you had him killed.

00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:37.185
Oh, please.

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.356
We are not having this
conversation.

00:59:41.389 --> 00:59:43.057
Oh, yes, we are.

00:59:43.091 --> 00:59:44.359
You need to come clean, Gabe.

00:59:44.392 --> 00:59:47.295
You're confused about
our relationship.

00:59:47.328 --> 00:59:51.032
You work for me.
You are my weapon.

00:59:51.065 --> 00:59:54.068
After all these years,
that's all I am to you?

00:59:54.669 --> 00:59:56.037
Jesus.

00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:58.673
Oh, you have a
short memory, Travis.

00:59:58.706 --> 01:00:03.044
It was me who plucked you
from your aimless life

01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:05.447
and turned you
into something special.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.183
But don't forget, I also have a
detailed record

01:00:08.216 --> 01:00:10.552
of every law you've ever broken.

01:00:10.585 --> 01:00:13.221
Everything I did was for you!

01:00:13.254 --> 01:00:16.558
I would suggest you show me
a little gratitude

01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:19.594
if you and your granddaughter
want anything

01:00:19.627 --> 01:00:22.030
that resembles a normal life.

01:00:22.063 --> 01:00:23.198
Count me out, Gabriel.

01:00:23.231 --> 01:00:25.567
Oh, no, no, Travis.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.768
There is no out for you.

01:00:29.237 --> 01:00:31.539
We are in this to the end.

01:00:31.573 --> 01:00:32.774
When does it end?

01:00:32.807 --> 01:00:35.009
When I say it does.

01:00:35.043 --> 01:00:39.280
No. My end is now. Right now.

01:00:45.153 --> 01:00:49.057
Good boy, Little Man. Stay.

01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:51.526
Stay.

01:00:53.761 --> 01:00:55.497
Stay... Uh-uh! Stay.

01:00:57.098 --> 01:00:58.466
Okay, get it.

01:01:00.702 --> 01:01:02.237
Hey, Pearl, what's news?

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:04.138
Your story's
getting some play.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.342
What do you mean?
I didn't write it.

01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:09.511
Ah, check the site.

01:01:19.554 --> 01:01:23.224
Needs a bit of polish, but your
word choices are delightful.

01:01:23.258 --> 01:01:24.826
Who knew that "dollop"
could be a verb?

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.461
- I know. I was just...
- Go!

01:01:26.494 --> 01:01:27.805
- I was just in the middle of...
- Go!

01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:30.298
- Mira.
- That was my lead.

01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:31.675
You've been comatose
and I didn't want

01:01:31.699 --> 01:01:33.635
the story to get
scooped up by another outlet.

01:01:33.668 --> 01:01:35.136
That's horseshit.

01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:36.814
You sent me home
so you could steal my story.

01:01:36.838 --> 01:01:39.240
I did not.

01:01:39.274 --> 01:01:41.142
And besides,
you're too close to it.

01:01:41.175 --> 01:01:42.277
Too close?

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:43.278
The only thing I'm too close to

01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:45.146
is punching you in the face.

01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:46.147
Please don't.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.116
Stay away from my story.

01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:50.685
Whatever.

01:01:50.718 --> 01:01:52.820
There's no real facts.

01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:54.622
It's hardly even a story.

01:01:57.158 --> 01:01:59.327
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

01:02:06.334 --> 01:02:08.536
What do you mean,
she's not coming over?

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:10.438
I'm making dinner
for her right now.

01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:12.391
Do you even
know what today was?

01:02:13.876 --> 01:02:15.643
What was today?

01:02:15.677 --> 01:02:18.446
Her school play
that you promised you'd come to.

01:02:18.479 --> 01:02:19.681
Shit.

01:02:19.714 --> 01:02:21.525
I'm not so sure that I
should let her stay with you

01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:23.184
when you're not even
responsible enough

01:02:23.217 --> 01:02:25.186
to show up for the easy stuff.

01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:27.655
I've... I've had a lot of things
on my mind.

01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:29.500
But apparently, Natalie
wasn't one of them.

01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:34.596
Okay, I... I deserve that.

01:02:34.629 --> 01:02:36.297
Yeah. You do.

01:02:37.365 --> 01:02:38.901
I'm... I'm coming over.

01:02:38.934 --> 01:02:40.869
No.

01:02:40.903 --> 01:02:42.604
I want to apologize to her
personally.

01:02:42.637 --> 01:02:44.339
No, you and
your paranoia

01:02:44.372 --> 01:02:46.174
can't get out of your own way.

01:02:46.207 --> 01:02:47.351
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.610
insecure, screwed up kid.

01:02:48.643 --> 01:02:50.778
You need to take care
of yourself, dad.

01:02:50.812 --> 01:02:52.647
Wait, Amanda. Amanda!

01:02:57.585 --> 01:02:59.463
<i>I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an...</i>

01:02:59.487 --> 01:03:01.465
<i>I'm not having you turn Natalie
into an insecure...</i>

01:03:01.489 --> 01:03:02.800
<i>I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an</i>

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:05.126
<i>insecure, screwed up kid.</i>

01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:37.902
Hey, you've reached Mira.

01:03:37.926 --> 01:03:39.460
You know what to do.

01:03:39.494 --> 01:03:43.564
Hi, Mira, it's me, Drew.
Just leaving the office now.

01:03:43.598 --> 01:03:46.734
Just wanted to say I'm a shit
for jumping your story.

01:03:48.536 --> 01:03:49.704
Hope you're feeling better.

01:03:54.275 --> 01:03:55.276
Um, I've got to go.

01:04:28.509 --> 01:04:30.278
You can't be serious.

01:05:04.479 --> 01:05:06.314
911,
what's your emergency?

01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:08.884
Yeah, I'm being chased
on the I-66.

01:05:10.384 --> 01:05:12.386
Oh, come on, really?

01:05:24.867 --> 01:05:26.267
Come on!

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.775
You okay, Drew?

01:06:07.809 --> 01:06:10.344
I don't... don't know.

01:06:35.736 --> 01:06:37.447
Just wanted to
say I'm a shit

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:39.407
for jumping your story.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.876
Hope you're feeling better.

01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:42.911
Ah, I've got to go.

01:06:42.945 --> 01:06:45.680
See what I mean?
You can hear it in his voice.

01:06:45.713 --> 01:06:48.716
- Something happened.
- Yeah.

01:06:48.749 --> 01:06:53.588
No, I hear you and see the dots
you're connecting, and, yes,

01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:57.625
that conclusion makes a lot of
sense right now, but...

01:06:57.658 --> 01:07:00.095
suggesting that the head of the
FBI had Drew killed

01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:02.130
because he printed a story?

01:07:02.164 --> 01:07:04.732
- Sounds crazy, right?
- Right.

01:07:04.765 --> 01:07:06.001
Yeah.

01:07:06.034 --> 01:07:10.172
Listen, honey, we're all
heartbroken, okay?

01:07:10.205 --> 01:07:12.875
But the reality is, this is
probably just a bad accident,

01:07:12.908 --> 01:07:15.844
or road rage or I... I don't know
whatever it might have been.

01:07:15.878 --> 01:07:18.746
But honestly, at this point,
sitting here playing detective,

01:07:18.779 --> 01:07:21.515
it is not going to
solve anything

01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:24.452
including a conspiracy theory.

01:07:32.895 --> 01:07:35.696
Operation Unity.
That's what Dusty called it.

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:37.132
That could mean anything.

01:07:37.165 --> 01:07:38.766
Dusty said that the FBI was

01:07:38.799 --> 01:07:41.003
crossing the line,
killing innocent civilians.

01:07:41.036 --> 01:07:42.503
His words.

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:43.882
And that he was coming to me
with his story

01:07:43.906 --> 01:07:47.910
because of my articles
about Sofia Flores.

01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:48.809
I'm not following.

01:07:48.844 --> 01:07:50.678
Sofia Flores was an
innocent civilian

01:07:50.711 --> 01:07:53.547
killed in an accidental
hit-and-run, unless...

01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:57.551
unless it wasn't an accident.

01:07:58.854 --> 01:08:00.788
So you think she was murdered
by the FBI

01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:02.991
and that is what crossed
Dusty's line?

01:08:03.025 --> 01:08:04.792
Maybe.

01:08:04.825 --> 01:08:06.694
If what
you're saying is true,

01:08:06.727 --> 01:08:08.763
with the way the world
is right now,

01:08:08.796 --> 01:08:11.166
this could wipe out the
FBI's highest ranks.

01:08:11.199 --> 01:08:13.634
As it should.

01:08:13.668 --> 01:08:17.005
You do realize
if your dots are correct

01:08:17.039 --> 01:08:21.043
and we play this wrong,
we could both end up like Sofia.

01:08:21.076 --> 01:08:23.644
And Dusty. And maybe Drew.

01:08:26.214 --> 01:08:27.849
Still wanna pursue it?

01:08:35.257 --> 01:08:36.791
We're sorry.

01:08:36.824 --> 01:08:39.194
The number you have reached
is not in service.

01:08:39.227 --> 01:08:40.528
Please check the...

01:08:42.697 --> 01:08:45.267
We're sorry. The number you have
reached is not in service.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.767
Sorry... Not in service...

01:08:46.801 --> 01:08:48.904
Please check the number
or try again.

01:08:48.937 --> 01:08:50.105
The number... Try again.

01:09:10.258 --> 01:09:11.826
I'm sorry, Mr. Block,

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.938
but your granddaughter no longer
goes to school here.

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:15.263
Since when?

01:09:15.297 --> 01:09:16.831
A few days ago.

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:19.267
Did her mother say
where they were moving?

01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:20.969
- No.
- But her school records...

01:09:21.003 --> 01:09:22.670
They had to be
forwarded somewhere.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:23.872
No, no one asked.

01:09:23.905 --> 01:09:25.706
I'm not sure what happened.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:28.043
I mean, usually we're given
plenty of notice...

01:09:30.312 --> 01:09:32.080
When did Amanda
quit the hospital?

01:09:32.114 --> 01:09:34.950
<i>Amanda quit the hospital.
Amanda quit the hospital.</i>

01:09:36.784 --> 01:09:38.719
<i>No, no, no, everything's fine.</i>

01:09:38.753 --> 01:09:40.654
<i>Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.</i>

01:09:40.688 --> 01:09:41.933
When did you last hear
from Natalie?

01:09:41.957 --> 01:09:43.158
<i>Natalie. Natalie.</i>

01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:44.592
<i>Natalie. No, no.</i>

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:45.994
<i>Amanda. Amanda. Amanda.</i>

01:09:46.028 --> 01:09:47.896
<i>When did my daughter
quit the hospital?</i>

01:09:47.929 --> 01:09:50.165
<i>Amanda. Amanda. When did
you last hear from Natalie?</i>

01:09:50.198 --> 01:09:52.034
Any idea where they might be?

01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:54.668
<i>Any idea
where they might be?</i>

01:09:54.702 --> 01:09:56.804
<i>So, no idea where they might be.</i>

01:09:58.206 --> 01:10:01.309
If fingers
need to be pointed,

01:10:01.343 --> 01:10:03.145
we know where to point them.

01:10:48.924 --> 01:10:50.225
Who is it?

01:10:50.258 --> 01:10:52.360
- It's me.
- Oh, God!

01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:54.963
It's okay, it's just Pearl.

01:10:56.398 --> 01:10:58.366
Thought I'd cheer you up.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.733
Dinner?

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.838
What am I looking at?

01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:06.341
Dusty Crane's rap sheet
I pulled off the police wire.

01:11:06.374 --> 01:11:07.909
And?

01:11:07.943 --> 01:11:10.711
Now we know he was an
undercover Federal agent,

01:11:10.744 --> 01:11:11.755
so this shouldn't
have been in the.

01:11:11.779 --> 01:11:13.115
National Crime's main system.

01:11:13.148 --> 01:11:15.683
To protect his identity.

01:11:15.716 --> 01:11:17.853
- Which means it's fake.
- It's fake.

01:11:17.886 --> 01:11:20.098
The only reason to do that would
be to spread misinformation

01:11:20.122 --> 01:11:22.756
in order to discredit him
as a potential source.

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:27.162
So someone like me
doesn't write his story.

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:29.865
Okay, I could buy that.

01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:31.166
But who?

01:11:34.936 --> 01:11:37.305
- Travis.
- What did you do?

01:11:37.339 --> 01:11:38.839
Senses return?

01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:40.741
You ready to get back
in the saddle?

01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:42.710
Where's my family?

01:11:42.743 --> 01:11:43.845
How the hell would I know?

01:11:43.879 --> 01:11:45.213
If I find out you had anything

01:11:45.247 --> 01:11:48.450
to do with Amanda and my
granddaughter disappearing,

01:11:48.483 --> 01:11:50.152
you're gonna need more men.

01:11:53.121 --> 01:11:55.924
I don't have a clue what
you're going on about.

01:11:56.858 --> 01:11:58.160
Now I know you've got a lot

01:11:58.193 --> 01:12:00.761
swirling around that
skull of yours,

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.098
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

01:12:03.131 --> 01:12:07.002
We always had
each other's back, remember?

01:12:07.035 --> 01:12:11.039
Now, let's go to the office
and talk about saving souls.

01:12:11.072 --> 01:12:15.877
I've told you before.
No. It's over.

01:12:15.911 --> 01:12:17.445
That's your decision.

01:12:17.479 --> 01:12:20.814
That's the wrong decision,
but yours.

01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:23.919
Excuse me.

01:12:28.822 --> 01:12:31.493
Last chance. Where are they?

01:12:31.526 --> 01:12:33.161
We're the FBI.

01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:37.065
We don't involve ourselves
in petty domestic disputes.

01:12:37.098 --> 01:12:39.901
He touches the car again,
shoot him.

01:12:44.105 --> 01:12:47.943
The great J. Edgar Hoover once
said, in a public forum no less,

01:12:47.976 --> 01:12:51.046
that the purpose of
counter-intelligence action

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:55.917
is to disrupt and it is
immaterial whether facts exist

01:12:55.951 --> 01:12:58.086
to substantiate the charge.

01:13:00.956 --> 01:13:03.992
If I were to say that in
public today, I can just imagine

01:13:04.025 --> 01:13:07.963
the media backlash that would
wash me out of this office.

01:13:07.996 --> 01:13:09.497
- It wouldn't be pretty, sir.
- No.

01:13:09.531 --> 01:13:13.902
Nowadays, this country is ruled
by gotcha moments on Twitter.

01:13:13.935 --> 01:13:16.304
But that doesn't mean
it's still not the truth.

01:13:16.338 --> 01:13:21.076
Hoover had COINTELPRO,
and I have Operation Unity.

01:13:21.109 --> 01:13:24.112
And as unpopular as
what we do may sound,

01:13:24.145 --> 01:13:27.382
History tells us that
spilling a little blood

01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:31.453
is absolutely necessary
to maintain law and order.

01:13:31.486 --> 01:13:36.091
Now, either Crane didn't
understand that, or didn't care.

01:13:36.124 --> 01:13:40.061
And now look at the mess
he's making me clean up.

01:13:40.095 --> 01:13:44.399
What's worse is, he's infected
someone... dear to me.

01:13:44.432 --> 01:13:45.533
Block.

01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:47.969
Been a good friend, family,

01:13:48.003 --> 01:13:50.138
for as long as I can remember.

01:13:50.171 --> 01:13:52.907
Sir, I may be
out of line here, but...

01:13:55.243 --> 01:13:57.212
would you like us
to have a word with him?

01:13:58.947 --> 01:14:02.017
Someone in the FBI created
a false criminal record

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:05.353
for a Federal agent involved in
a secret FBI program.

01:14:05.387 --> 01:14:08.256
That fake record was then sent
out on the police wire

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:10.892
so that the media
would ignore him.

01:14:10.925 --> 01:14:12.560
Drew obviously didn't.

01:14:12.594 --> 01:14:15.430
And now that agent
and Drew are both dead.

01:14:15.463 --> 01:14:16.965
Interesting.

01:14:18.466 --> 01:14:20.201
Almost.

01:14:20.235 --> 01:14:22.937
We run that, and tomorrow we get
a simple, logical explanation.

01:14:22.971 --> 01:14:24.306
We have no proof to refute it.

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:26.875
Or corrupt FBI agents
following us home.

01:14:26.908 --> 01:14:28.176
- And then there's that.
- Fine.

01:14:28.209 --> 01:14:30.111
You want more proof,
I'll just call the FBI

01:14:30.145 --> 01:14:32.089
and ask for an interview with
the asshole that killed Dusty.

01:14:32.113 --> 01:14:34.049
Mira, I know this is
frustrating,

01:14:34.082 --> 01:14:36.017
but what we need is
an actual living person

01:14:36.051 --> 01:14:37.585
who can help tell the story.

01:14:37.619 --> 01:14:40.588
Someone with specifics who can
help fill in the basics.

01:14:40.622 --> 01:14:44.459
The who, the what, the when.
And if we're lucky, the why.

01:14:44.492 --> 01:14:46.027
The why is obvious.

01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:48.330
Obvious to you
isn't good enough.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:51.066
Listen, if we are dealing
with a corrupt head of the FBI,

01:14:51.099 --> 01:14:53.077
they will cover up the cover up
with another cover up

01:14:53.101 --> 01:14:54.602
and they'll spin it as
some top secret

01:14:54.636 --> 01:14:56.204
national security operation
that hides

01:14:56.237 --> 01:14:58.206
behind the veil of need-to-know.

01:14:58.239 --> 01:15:01.910
The American people
need to know the truth.

01:15:01.943 --> 01:15:03.611
That's what
I used to think.

01:15:03.645 --> 01:15:05.347
And you don't anymore?

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.183
Honestly, undecided.

01:15:08.216 --> 01:15:10.185
Sometimes I think
it's better to live

01:15:10.218 --> 01:15:12.220
in the happiness of the unknown.

01:15:13.621 --> 01:15:15.190
The United States government is

01:15:15.223 --> 01:15:17.392
murdering its own
innocent citizens.

01:15:20.962 --> 01:15:22.097
Yeah.

01:15:23.631 --> 01:15:24.966
That is messed up.

01:15:26.134 --> 01:15:28.536
We need to nail these assholes.

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:30.238
Nothing? Nothing?

01:15:30.271 --> 01:15:32.474
No forwarding address?
No phone records?

01:15:32.507 --> 01:15:33.975
Would you be able to pull

01:15:34.008 --> 01:15:36.111
school enrollment records
for Natalie Block?

01:15:36.144 --> 01:15:37.679
Check the entire country.

01:15:37.712 --> 01:15:39.347
Actually, Sam, one more thing.

01:15:39.381 --> 01:15:41.116
Search all informants
who recently entered.

01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:42.384
Witness Protection.

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:43.928
They may have changed
their last names,

01:15:43.952 --> 01:15:45.553
but they would have kept
their first.

01:15:45.587 --> 01:15:47.489
Amanda and Natalie.

01:15:47.522 --> 01:15:49.457
Okay. Hey... hey, Sam.

01:15:49.491 --> 01:15:51.159
Let's keep this between us.

01:15:51.192 --> 01:15:53.628
Do this for me,
consider us even.

01:15:53.661 --> 01:15:54.662
Thanks, Sam.

01:16:01.569 --> 01:16:03.538
Block.

01:16:03.571 --> 01:16:05.707
Oh, yeah, uh, Mira.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.910
Listen, uh, now's not
a good time.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.048
What do you have?

01:16:14.082 --> 01:16:15.550
Robinson's very capable

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:18.286
when it comes
to cleaning up his messes.

01:16:18.319 --> 01:16:21.055
I would say this has his
fingerprints all over it.

01:16:21.089 --> 01:16:24.492
I need a quote
from a reliable source.

01:16:24.526 --> 01:16:27.128
I'm the last person
you want as a source.

01:16:27.162 --> 01:16:28.396
But you know it's wrong.

01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:31.032
I know what I know,
but my hands are dirty.

01:16:31.065 --> 01:16:33.501
You put my name out there,
my credibility,

01:16:33.535 --> 01:16:35.303
it'll come into question.

01:16:35.336 --> 01:16:36.438
Even my sanity.

01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:38.306
They'll say I made the
whole thing up,

01:16:38.339 --> 01:16:41.576
all in the name of
protecting myself.

01:16:41.609 --> 01:16:44.512
Probably wind up like Dusty.

01:16:44.546 --> 01:16:46.190
I still don't understand
why Robinson

01:16:46.214 --> 01:16:48.082
would go to all these lengths.

01:16:49.117 --> 01:16:53.021
Same reason Hoover did it
for almost 50 years.

01:16:53.054 --> 01:16:55.423
To maintain power, control,

01:16:55.457 --> 01:16:58.526
which will give him a
shelf life that'll outlast

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.297
every politician on Capitol Hill
and in the White House.

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:04.466
You can't let them
get away with this.

01:17:04.499 --> 01:17:07.469
I mean, this is your chance
to right all your wrongs.

01:17:07.502 --> 01:17:10.171
What's done is done.
There's no going backwards.

01:17:10.205 --> 01:17:12.207
Then let's go forward
and prevent Robinson

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.709
from abusing his power
in the future.

01:17:14.742 --> 01:17:16.144
If we don't stand up to him,

01:17:16.177 --> 01:17:18.112
he'll just keep growing
Operation Unity.

01:17:19.113 --> 01:17:20.381
He probably will.

01:17:20.415 --> 01:17:24.085
Remember, it's your job
to protect the agents.

01:17:24.118 --> 01:17:25.629
How many more Dusty's
have to die for you

01:17:25.653 --> 01:17:26.764
to stop looking the other way?

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.595
As long as I've worked
for Robinson,

01:17:33.628 --> 01:17:37.232
I've... I've never heard
of Operation Unity.

01:17:37.265 --> 01:17:38.500
Somebody must know.

01:17:38.533 --> 01:17:40.602
These sort of people
don't talk out of turn.

01:17:40.635 --> 01:17:43.538
Maybe, but secrets
this big can't hide forever.

01:17:47.141 --> 01:17:49.377
Robinson has a safe in his house

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.813
where he keeps a
record of everyone

01:17:51.847 --> 01:17:54.282
and everything
the Bureau touches.

01:17:54.315 --> 01:17:57.085
- Everything?
- Everything.

01:17:57.118 --> 01:17:59.521
It's his security blanket,

01:17:59.554 --> 01:18:03.725
ammunition in case anyone
decides to turn against him.

01:18:03.758 --> 01:18:10.164
If there's a paper trail on
Operation Unity, it's in there.

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:10.652
What do you mean,
he blew up your car?

01:20:10.685 --> 01:20:12.925
Block shot it
with a grenade launcher.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.895
I must never
underestimate that man.

01:20:22.597 --> 01:20:25.400
Where is the crazy
son-of-a-bitch now?

01:20:25.433 --> 01:20:26.768
Don't know.

01:20:27.769 --> 01:20:29.671
Well, I do.

01:20:29.704 --> 01:20:30.805
He's here.

01:20:30.838 --> 01:20:34.409
- Here as in?
- As in, my front door.

01:20:34.442 --> 01:20:37.645
If you're not too busy,
you might wanna stop by.

01:20:45.586 --> 01:20:47.321
Wasn't expecting you.

01:20:48.623 --> 01:20:50.291
Got a minute?

01:20:56.497 --> 01:20:59.267
- You sent them. Right.
- I sent who?

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.436
You know, if you were
just honest with me,

01:21:01.469 --> 01:21:02.971
I'd have more respect for you.

01:21:03.005 --> 01:21:05.373
I take it this isn't
a friendly pop in.

01:21:05.406 --> 01:21:06.607
What the hell do you want?

01:21:06.641 --> 01:21:08.977
All your files
on Operation Unity.

01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:10.678
I'm afraid that's not happening.

01:21:11.847 --> 01:21:13.614
It's not a request, Gabriel.

01:21:15.316 --> 01:21:16.952
This is a huge mistake.

01:21:16.985 --> 01:21:18.987
I'll add it to my list.
Open it.

01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:20.555
Or what?

01:21:20.588 --> 01:21:22.757
Are you really gonna
shoot me, Travis?

01:21:23.758 --> 01:21:25.293
Yes, I will.

01:21:31.033 --> 01:21:32.433
The hard drive.

01:21:32.467 --> 01:21:34.335
I need to see what's on it.

01:21:34.368 --> 01:21:35.837
Load it up.

01:21:43.778 --> 01:21:45.446
Step aside.

01:21:50.618 --> 01:21:53.321
The world isn't ready
to see what's on that drive.

01:21:53.354 --> 01:21:55.523
The truth can be difficult,

01:21:55.556 --> 01:21:57.592
but it's better than
the alternative.

01:22:11.539 --> 01:22:13.075
You two, take the back.

01:24:11.193 --> 01:24:13.896
I recommend you walk away.

01:24:13.929 --> 01:24:16.164
This is not your fight.

01:24:16.198 --> 01:24:18.532
You were just taking orders.

01:24:42.124 --> 01:24:44.159
Robinson's using you.

01:24:44.192 --> 01:24:45.961
The way he used me.

01:24:48.196 --> 01:24:50.631
We're just bullets
in his chamber.

01:25:19.593 --> 01:25:21.129
Enough is enough!

01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:03.738
Ah.

01:27:59.087 --> 01:28:00.688
Travis.

01:28:28.416 --> 01:28:30.751
- Who are you?
- Uh...

01:28:30.784 --> 01:28:32.387
This is Pearl.
She works with me.

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.890
Please don't shoot her.

01:28:36.925 --> 01:28:38.792
Can we trust her with this?

01:28:38.826 --> 01:28:40.262
We can.

01:28:46.067 --> 01:28:48.003
Donuts? Really?

01:28:48.036 --> 01:28:50.005
It... it was all I could
find in this dump.

01:28:50.038 --> 01:28:52.174
So, Robinson hid
Amanda and Natalie

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.742
in Witness Protection?

01:28:54.775 --> 01:28:56.744
But no idea where they are?

01:28:57.445 --> 01:28:59.247
Uh-huh, okay.

01:28:59.281 --> 01:29:00.348
Thanks, Sam.

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:02.683
Yeah. Appreciate you looking.

01:29:10.058 --> 01:29:12.494
Using your family as leverage
against you is so effing wrong.

01:29:12.527 --> 01:29:14.196
Sorry to say.

01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:17.933
Seems relatively minor compared
to everything else he's doing.

01:29:17.966 --> 01:29:21.303
Character assassinations,
political blackmail.

01:29:21.336 --> 01:29:22.938
Looks like flat out murder.

01:29:22.971 --> 01:29:26.107
All under the guise
of protecting democracy.

01:29:26.141 --> 01:29:28.709
What does it say
about Dusty Crane?

01:29:31.012 --> 01:29:32.356
Looks like you've got
everything you'd ever

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:33.481
want to know about him.

01:29:33.515 --> 01:29:35.083
Oh, there's a video.

01:29:35.116 --> 01:29:36.251
Play it.

01:29:37.385 --> 01:29:39.354
Dustin Crane, Special Agent.

01:29:39.387 --> 01:29:41.489
Your mission?

01:29:41.523 --> 01:29:43.291
You know that.
It's deep infill.

01:29:43.325 --> 01:29:46.528
Have you maintained
contact with the target?

01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:49.497
Yes, the target's name
is Sofia Flores.

01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:51.799
How often
is your exposure?

01:29:51.832 --> 01:29:53.001
Every day,
at least

01:29:53.034 --> 01:29:54.835
a few hours a day,
sometimes longer.

01:29:54.869 --> 01:29:56.147
How have you
been able to maintain that

01:29:56.171 --> 01:29:59.341
level of contact with
an unsuspecting target?

01:29:59.374 --> 01:30:02.310
She, uh, she thinks
I'm her boyfriend.

01:30:03.511 --> 01:30:04.980
And?

01:30:05.013 --> 01:30:06.982
Are you her boyfriend?

01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:10.852
I'd like to think so.

01:30:10.885 --> 01:30:12.988
How long has
this been going on?

01:30:15.857 --> 01:30:18.260
A little over a year now.

01:30:18.293 --> 01:30:21.029
And she has
no idea who you really are?

01:30:22.364 --> 01:30:24.966
No, no. No, she doesn't.

01:30:29.571 --> 01:30:31.873
You can see
it in his face.

01:30:31.906 --> 01:30:33.842
They were in love.

01:30:34.876 --> 01:30:36.777
I feel sick.

01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:05.206
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:09.277
You knew Dusty Crane was
in love with Sofia Flores.

01:31:09.311 --> 01:31:10.211
Travis!

01:31:10.245 --> 01:31:12.314
You got nervous he might
come clean to her.

01:31:12.347 --> 01:31:14.282
The thought that someone
with her influence

01:31:14.316 --> 01:31:16.584
might find out what you were
up to scared you.

01:31:16.618 --> 01:31:18.586
You slippery shit.

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.088
Pull the damn car over.

01:31:20.121 --> 01:31:22.924
That's why you killed her,
and then him.

01:31:22.957 --> 01:31:24.893
To protect your
secret operation.

01:31:24.926 --> 01:31:26.961
You know nothing.

01:31:31.266 --> 01:31:32.233
Listen carefully.

01:31:32.267 --> 01:31:35.403
Operation Unity is going public.
The whole thing.

01:31:35.437 --> 01:31:37.539
- Bullshit.
- You need to listen.

01:31:37.572 --> 01:31:39.207
Not to you, I don't.

01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:43.912
How about now?

01:31:45.613 --> 01:31:47.615
Our arrangement never happened.

01:31:47.649 --> 01:31:49.217
You're going to destroy my file

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:51.186
and forget everything
I've done for you.

01:31:51.219 --> 01:31:52.987
After that, you will go public

01:31:53.021 --> 01:31:54.622
with the truth
about the operation.

01:31:54.656 --> 01:31:56.424
I am the director of the most

01:31:56.458 --> 01:31:59.594
powerful organization
in the world.

01:31:59.627 --> 01:32:02.464
I will not bargain with you.

01:32:02.497 --> 01:32:04.366
Then call it coercion.

01:32:04.399 --> 01:32:07.435
If I'm not being convincing
enough, there are other ways.

01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:24.285
Ahh!

01:32:33.128 --> 01:32:35.997
Fine. We'll do it your way.

01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:37.499
I'll clean your record.

01:32:37.532 --> 01:32:41.236
But there is no chance in hell
I am admitting to anything,

01:32:41.269 --> 01:32:45.473
and if I hear a whisper
of Operation Unity in the press,

01:32:45.507 --> 01:32:48.910
you'll be indicted
before the day is over.

01:32:50.645 --> 01:32:55.150
That was the last threat
you will ever make to me.

01:32:55.183 --> 01:32:57.485
You wanna put a bullet
in your old friend?

01:32:59.521 --> 01:33:01.556
Go ahead.

01:33:01.589 --> 01:33:04.058
You'd be doing me a favor.

01:33:05.026 --> 01:33:06.494
Please, do it.

01:33:08.263 --> 01:33:09.597
Do it!

01:33:14.302 --> 01:33:15.303
No.

01:33:15.336 --> 01:33:17.138
You're not getting
off that easy.

01:33:17.172 --> 01:33:19.073
The truth needs to be told.

01:33:19.107 --> 01:33:22.010
And you're gonna be
the one to tell it.

01:33:22.043 --> 01:33:25.947
But first, you tell me.
Where's my family?

01:33:57.779 --> 01:33:59.380
There she is!

01:33:59.414 --> 01:34:00.548
Grandpa!

01:34:00.582 --> 01:34:03.351
Hey, come here to me.

01:34:03.384 --> 01:34:05.487
You don't need to worry,
nobody's out there.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.188
I've already checked.

01:34:07.222 --> 01:34:09.224
Good, and there
probably never will be.

01:34:09.257 --> 01:34:11.292
That's just how
my brain is wired.

01:34:11.326 --> 01:34:12.460
I know.

01:34:12.494 --> 01:34:13.728
I missed you.

01:34:13.761 --> 01:34:15.396
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:16.698
Everything okay?

01:34:16.731 --> 01:34:18.509
Just never thought we'd
be in Witness Protection.

01:34:18.533 --> 01:34:20.668
- Sorry about all that.
- It's alright. We're fine.

01:34:20.702 --> 01:34:23.338
I'm just sorry about everything
that you've been through.

01:34:23.371 --> 01:34:25.440
- Is everything okay with you?
- Couldn't be better.

01:34:26.207 --> 01:34:29.110
- Anybody wanna go home?
- I do!

01:34:29.143 --> 01:34:31.079
- I do!
- Me, too.

01:34:32.747 --> 01:34:35.517
"Robinson was indicted
after admitting to the existence

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:37.252
of the morally
reprehensible program

01:34:37.285 --> 01:34:39.521
he dubbed Operation Unity.

01:34:39.554 --> 01:34:42.190
He remains behind bars,
awaiting trial."

01:34:42.223 --> 01:34:43.691
Look at these comments.

01:34:43.725 --> 01:34:45.660
"Explosive."

01:34:45.693 --> 01:34:48.229
"The News Cycle at its finest."

01:34:48.263 --> 01:34:49.373
Don't forget this one.

01:34:49.397 --> 01:34:51.299
"Award-worthy reporting."

01:34:52.267 --> 01:34:54.035
I'm proud of you, Mira.

01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:01.276
I saw it.

01:35:01.309 --> 01:35:03.444
Well, what do you think?

01:35:03.478 --> 01:35:06.849
Very thorough.
I, uh...

01:35:06.882 --> 01:35:11.286
I was surprised you didn't
mention my Vietnam mishap.

01:35:11.319 --> 01:35:12.687
No use for you being on trial

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.256
for something you did
when you were a kid.

01:35:21.596 --> 01:35:23.431
Article's good.

01:35:23.464 --> 01:35:24.599
Thank you.

01:35:24.632 --> 01:35:27.535
For... everything.

01:35:27.569 --> 01:35:29.837
I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:35:29.872 --> 01:35:34.676
And I wouldn't have done it
without you, so... thank you.

01:35:35.878 --> 01:35:37.445
You're welcome.

01:35:37.478 --> 01:35:39.447
Take care, Mira.

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.648
You too.

01:35:43.852 --> 01:35:46.454
Ah, a little help, please.

01:35:47.555 --> 01:35:50.091
Run, run, run!
Keep running!

01:35:50.926 --> 01:35:52.760
Go! That's a girl.

01:35:52.794 --> 01:35:54.495
That's it, keep going.

01:35:54.529 --> 01:35:57.699
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's flying! It's flying!

01:35:57.732 --> 01:35:58.766
Atta girl.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.134
You're pretty good at that.

01:36:00.168 --> 01:36:03.438
A bit rusty. Go!

01:36:03.471 --> 01:36:05.874
You sure you don't wanna hang
out with us this weekend?

01:36:05.908 --> 01:36:07.442
I'm good.

01:36:08.743 --> 01:36:10.178
I have a date.

01:36:10.211 --> 01:36:12.313
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we'll see.

01:36:12.347 --> 01:36:14.258
But if you or Natalie need
anything, just let me know.

01:36:14.282 --> 01:36:15.350
Uh-huh. Will do.

01:36:15.383 --> 01:36:16.751
And don't forget to feed her.

01:36:16.784 --> 01:36:18.262
Make sure she brushes
her teeth, get her to school

01:36:18.286 --> 01:36:19.487
on time, Monday morning.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.857
Food, teeth, school.
Consider it done.

01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.391
Anything else?

01:36:24.292 --> 01:36:26.494
No shooting guns.

01:36:26.527 --> 01:36:27.662
Uh-huh.

01:36:28.663 --> 01:36:30.264
No guns.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.302
